## Breaking changes ðŸš¨

### API Tokens

All API tokens have changed. You can retrieve the existing ones from their respective page. If you're using the browser extension, you can either logout and login again, or set the token in the new extension's preferences dialog (reachable from the browser's extension list).

### Application Passwords

If you're using application passwords, you'll have to refresh them. For each password you use, you can now refresh it in order to obtain a new one.

### Publicly shared bookmarks

Links of shared bookmarks have changed. Either wait 24h before upgrading or send the new ones to your contacts.
